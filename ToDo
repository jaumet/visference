VISFERENCE
--------------

ToDo at July, 11th 2013

SuperList index2:
- Add multi checkbox filters: http://www.webegg.co.uk/jquery-multiple-filter/

SuperList index2:
- on click filters, change class to active
- Table head is hardcoded. It needs to be taken from "data/my.json"
DONE- Table: the titles doesn't need to be centered in the TD. Define a class for the non-title-TDs
DONE- Counter is not well positioned.

HTML, Visference builder:
1- Edit & Build "data/filters.json"

2- Build "data/my.json"
	2.1- Upload bibtex file 
	2.2- Python parser: from "data/mybib.json" build "data/my.json" (only the values for "id" and "title")
	2.3- Add the Topics for each paper => how to do this depends on the format of this data

3- Take "data/filters.json" and "data/my.json" and build a form to edit the values "axisX"

----------------------

Then, discuss about:
- AREA
	- Need to be adapted to read from the json files (!)

- Tilebars/Texty
